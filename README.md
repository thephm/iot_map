# iotmap

This is code from a few years ago for a node.js "interactive" map of all things IoT around the world. 

I stopped working on it and just putting it on github for my safe keeping and may look at it again.

If you clone this, it likely won't work at all so I wouldn't even bother.

I will need to push my Mongo dump as well which has all of the company and people information.

The `docs/IoT Thing of Things.xlsx` is a spreadsheet of companies and products that I hadn't yet added into Mongo. Kind of a backlog if you will.

### Setup

Old notes in [[docs/setup.md]]
